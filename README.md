# Project Title

Animals

# Full stack example with Ionic + Express+ Sequelize + MySQL

As the header says, a project with Ionic, Express, Sequelize and MySQL based on the notes of Tiburcio Cruz is just that.

Initially appeared on
[gist](https://github.com/ngallojdam/AnimalsIonicExpressSequelize). But the page cannot open anymore so that is why I have moved it here.
